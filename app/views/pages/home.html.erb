        <p>London-based live sound and recording studio specialist with
          over five years professional experience in an educational
          facility working as a technician, audio engineer and IT deputy.
          I started <span class="highlight"> Copson Studio Wiring </span> (CSW) in 2020 as a side job
          when I saw an opportunity during the pandemic where many
          people wanted to continue producing music but they had to
          do so from home. They had the musical knowledge to
          produce but some were struggling with setting up a studio to
          work in.

        <p>I've been involved in the construction of close to forty studios since 2017. Everything from
          small home studios to full-size large format console rooms, home cinemas, and even Dolby
          Atmos, suites, I look forward to bringing whatever your dream studio vision is to life. I've
          teamed up with SXPro and Flavio Acoustics to bring you the best setup to suit your workflow.

        <p>Sean came to patch in the tie lines for our new studio. He was very quick and efficient, and did a clean job fitting them in. Sean is personable and professional, and we'd be happy to recommend him!
